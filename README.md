# Course 7 Project

## Introduction

We work for Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry. We are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). We are particularly interested in the following two questions:

- Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG
- Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions
